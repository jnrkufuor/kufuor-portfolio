  <p><h5>Hi!</h5> My name is Ernest Kufuor. I am a designer with a keen interest in Applied Machine Learning and Software Engineering. My passion is really in the abstract: colors, graphics, lines â€¦ anything that speaks to me aesthetically. This portfolio contains some of my work for a course I am taking. My goal is to explore data visualization and  I hope to achieve this through this portfolio.
