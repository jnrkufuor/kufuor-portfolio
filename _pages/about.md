  <p><h5>Hi!</h5> My name is Ernest Kufuor. I am a Ghanaian doing my master’s at Carnegie Mellon University in Information Technology with a specialization in Applied Machine Learning and Software Engineering. My pronouns are he and him. I have been into software engineering and data science for a while but my passion is really in the abstract: colors, graphics, lines … anything that speaks to me aesthetically. My love language I guess..
</p>

<h5>My Journey?</h5>
<p>
I have been into UI/UX and corporate design for some time now. Most of the skills I picked through experience or people. Moving into a new field, applied machine learning, I sometimes wonder how some of the skills I have nurtured over the years can be combined with the technical aspects of machine learning.
</p>

<p>
Data adds a new dimension towards graphics because there is much more to be considered now when trying to design for audiences while keeping the integrity, relevance and impact of the data purposeful. I hope that through this journey, I learn how to maneuver through the different aspects of data visualization and pick up the necessary skills to create not a perfect chart, a good one.
</p>

<p>
Once I graduate, there are a number of roads I do want to go down in as disjoint as there may be. Machine learning and software engineering are definitely on the table however, I gained a particular interest in finding a data visualization job after hearing about a lady at the World Bank making waves with her dataviz efforts. I am also thinking of entering the work of baking and cooking building up to my dream of having a coffee shop franchise. Additionally, my affinity to want to give back has increased over the years and there is a growing passion of starting a small food shelter back home.

All in all, I hope to give it my best and have fun while at it
